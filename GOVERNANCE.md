# Web-Server Frameworks Team

For the current list of Team members, see the project
[README.md](./README.md).

## Members

The [nodejs/web-server-frameworks](https://github.com/nodejs/web-server-frameworks) GitHub
repository is maintained by the Team and additional Members who are
added on an ongoing basis.

## Team Membership

Team Membership is not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the Team.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for Team Membership beyond these rules.

Changes to Team membership should be proposed with an issue and labelled `web-server-framework-agenda`
to be included in the next [team meeting](#team-meetings). Decisions are made via the
[Consensus Seeking Process](#consensus-seeking-process). If there are not objections in the
issue new members may attend the meeting in which their membership is officially accepted.

If a Team member is unable to attend a meeting where a planned membership decision is being made,
then their consent is assumed.

## Team Meetings

The Team meets bi-weekly on Zoom.us. A designated moderator
approved by the Team runs the meeting. Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.

Items are added to the Team agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, Team membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
Team member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***web-server-frameworks-agenda*** tag to the issue.

Prior to each Team meeting the moderator will share the agenda with
members of the Team. Team members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the Team
cannot veto or remove items.

The Team may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to
participate in a non-voting capacity.

Decisions in meetings are made via the [Consensus Seeking Process](#Consensus-Seeking-Process)
and require a quorum of 50% of Members.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The Team follows a
[Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus, the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus, a Team member can call for
the item to be decided by a vote or to table the issue to the next
meeting. In both cases the decision must be seconded by a majority of the Team
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins. Only Active
Members participate in a vote.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests that do not change the governance of the team can be merged into
this repository provided the following conditions have been met:

* There are no outstanding objections
* There are two approvals by team members
* The PR has been open for at least 48 hours

Pull requests that change governance of the team must meet the following conditions
in addition to the ones listed for regular PRs.

* The PR has been open for at least 7 days OR consensus is reached in a meeting
  with quorum of members.

If consensus cannot be reached, a pull request may still be landed after a vote
by the members to override outstanding objections.

### Fast-Tracking PRs

Special exception is made for pull requests seeking to make any of the following
changes to this repository:

- Errata fixes.
- Editorial changes.
- Meeting minutes.
- Updates to the team lists.
- Doc Fixes.

To propose fast-tracking a pull request, apply the ***fast-track*** label. Then add a comment that members may upvote.

If someone disagrees with the fast-tracking request, remove the label. Do not fast-track the pull request in that case.

The pull request may be fast-tracked if two members approve the fast-tracking request. To land, the pull request itself still needs two member approvals.

Members may request fast-tracking of pull requests they did not author. In that case only, the request itself is also one fast-track approval. Upvote the comment anyway to avoid any doubt.
