# Web-Server Frameworks Team

## Purpose

The Web-Server Frameworks Team is a place for Node.js framework authors and users to collaborate on the
future direction and feature set of the frameworks and related Node.js core APIs.  The main goal of the
team is to improve collaboration across the ecosystem and foster a better dialog between all parties involved.

### Goals

Topics which this team discussed or challenges this team decides to take on should fall under one of the goals of the team:

- Improve Node.js core api support for frameworks
- Provide feedback and collaboration on Node.js core features and proposals
- Improve collaboration among framework authors
- Provide support for frameworks when security issues or bugs arise
- Be a resource for Node.js security concerns in APIs which touch web frameworks (ex. HTTP1/2/3)
- Collaborate with other Node.js WGs and teams where it makes sense

Things which should not be done in this repo:

- Framework wars
- Promotion of specific tools/resource/etc. without a clear topic for collaboration/discussion
- Putting down projects, authors or solutions to a problem
- Determine what is/is not a framework
- Maintain a list of frameworks, framework authors or maintainers

## Joining

We encourage participation from members across the Node.js and JavaScript
ecosystem. Feel free to join scheduled meetings and participate
in the issues within this repository.

## How to Join
